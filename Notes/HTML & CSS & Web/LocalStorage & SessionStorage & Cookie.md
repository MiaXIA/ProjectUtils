# LocalStorage & SessionStorage & Cookie
LocalStorage and SessionStorage are new features for HTML5 web storage, it has some similar functions as Cookie such as store user settings

## LocalStorage
It stores PERMANATELY unless clear it in code. The regular space is 5 mb and only stores in browser. LocalStorage will not commute between servers.

```Javascript
localStorage.setItem("key", "value"); //set a k:v value
localStorage.getItem("key");//get the key value
localStorage.key;
localStorage.removeItem("key"); //remove the key value
localStorage.clear(); //clear all localStorage data
localStorage.hasOwnProperty("key") //check if key value is existed
```

## SessionStorage
It stores TEMPORARILY in the window tab, close the window tab or browser will lost the data. Different window tabs in one browser will not share the data.

```Javascript
sessionStorage.setItem("key", "value"); //set a k:v value
sessionStorage.getItem("key"); //get the key value
sessionStorage.removeItem("key"); //remove the key value
sessionStorage.clear(); //clear all sessionStorage data
```

## Cookie
Generated by server, it can set expire time. If it generated from browser, the default expire time is when you close the browser. The storage space is about 4 KB, it will contains inside request header, if there are many data inside cookie the network will take longer time to response. 

## Usage
Cookie: used for user identification, user login keys
LocalStorage: used for user preference setting, shopping carts
SessionStorage: used for forms for multiple pages

## [DetectPrivateMode](https://github.com/MiaXIA/ProjectUtils/tree/master/DetectPrivateMode)
With browsers' private mode web storage will have different storage time, sometimes we need to detect if user is using private mode and alert the feature difference if you are using web storage in that project.
